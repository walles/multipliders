A game where maths challenges fall down from the sky and you can shoot
them by typing the correct answer.

# TODO
* Shoot numbers when keys are pressed
* Add feedback on key presses
* Add a launch screen
* Add a level-failed screen
* Add a level-success screen
* Add starry background
* Adapt challenges font size to screen
* Profile game for memory allocations
* Profile game for CPU usage while drawing

  good for production. Verify that we can easily show the controls
  when they are hidden.
* Pause game while controls are visible
* Add a license
* Make an icon
* Make a "Feature Graphics"
* Publish on Google Play


## DONE
* Make text move down from top
* Add more falling text when the first text is 20% down
* View controls by default so that we can pause the game easily, good
  for development.
