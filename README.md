A game where maths challenges fall down from the sky and you can shoot
them by typing the correct answer.

# TODO
* Add a numeric keyboard
* Add a launch screen
* Add a level-failed screen
* Add a level-success screen
* Add starry background
* Profile game for memory allocations
* Profile game for CPU usage while drawing
* Hide controls by default so that we get the full-screen experience,
  good for production.

## DONE
* Make text move down from top
* Add more falling text when the first text is 20% down
* View controls by default so that we can pause the game easily, good
  for development.
